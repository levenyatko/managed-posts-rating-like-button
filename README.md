For more advanced control, select the "Manually" value for the "Display" select and use the provided shortcodes in your post content or templates:

* `[mpr-button id="XX" disabled="false"]` - Display the like button for a specific post (replace "XX" with the post ID). Use the "disabled" attribute if you want to show the "like" button but disallow voting.
